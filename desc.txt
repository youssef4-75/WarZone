zone war

how it works, ai vs human, in turns? 

in turn 

each one have three pin

each turn you can decide either to put a pin, 
    or to move your existing pin to another place
    

the field is a grid that contains 20x20 case 

if a pin is put in a case, it start elarging its area 
each turn, a pin that havent moved yet give to the player to play this: 
    chose one neighbor case to the area of that pin,
        if it is not colored yet, you colorify it 
        if it is colorified with your opponent color, you remove the color 
        if colorified by you, nothing happen 
        
the AI will decide based on your area wich pin to move or (if possible) where to put the new pin
and where to do the expansion operation, wheter to gain new territory or to got new one


you cant uncolorify a case with the opponent pin, unless it is the only case colorified by that pin 
if uncolorifying the case with a pin, the pin is removed and it cant be put again untill 3 turns


if an area that is colorified with two pins, randomly one of them is eliminated, the area remains colored


the case that change its color (colored or uncolored) remains protected from modifications for one turn 



scale of the grid and the number of pin for each player is modifyable, but for the game,  it will be 20x20 and 3 pins

recap: 

each turn there are two phases: 

each turn, you either envade, revive, or move

envade, choose a pin to 


phase1: 
    decide the pin to move or to make enter 
note about this phase: 
    outsider pins cant be entered unless they passed 3 turns outside 
    moved pin can move one step each turn, choose the moving direction
    entered pin are randomly distributed in the field
    in general, you need to give (pin[0-2], direction[0-3]) possibilities: 12 -> bits needed: 4




phase2: 
    decide cases to unlock or to liberate, thus they are protected for the next turn 
    
note about this phase: 
    you cant choose a non neighbor case to modify  
    you cant choose a case with opponent pin if it has neighbor case with his color 
    you cant choose a protected case 
    you need to give a pin 
    

the game ends if a player have no pin in the field, or after a number of turns, if so, the player with more case wins
